# TextRC: Text Relayed over RSS Channels

### Project Overview

The goal of TextRC is to provide a simple, minimalistic platform for users to:

  - Set up an RSS channel with a personalized identity, including a name, bio, channel image, and optional contact information.
  - Post short updates that are relayed to subscribers via RSS feeds.
  - Embrace the ethos of simplicity and self-hosted solutions.

### Why RSS?
- **Tried and True**: RSS has stood the test of time as a reliable, decentralized format for sharing updates.
- **No Algorithms**: RSS delivers content in chronological order, free from manipulative algorithms that prey on emotions.
- **No Vanity Metrics**: TextRC avoids likes, follow counts, or engagement metrics, focusing solely on content.
- **Platform Independence**: Your content isn’t tied to a single app or company. It’s accessible on any RSS reader.
- **Encourages Interaction**: RSS supports meaningful interactions by directing readers to contact you via email (burner email recommended), visit your website, or connect through social media.

### What TextRC Is (and Is Not)
- **TextRC is not social media**. It’s a tool to create and share simple, basic updates that anyone can follow without being tied to a closed ecosystem.
- It’s a minimalist approach to publishing updates, built on a tried-and-true foundation of RSS.

TextRC is perfect for those who want to **share updates without noise, clutter, or reliance on big platforms**.

### Current Status

TextRC is in the alpha stage of development. The following are being implemented:

  - A script to create an RSS channel file (rss.xml), defining a user’s RSS "identity."
  - A script to post updates to the channel, focusing on minimal and effective text relay.
