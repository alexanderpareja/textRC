# TextRC: Text RSS Channels

### Project Overview

The goal of TextRC is to provide a simple, minimalistic platform for users to:

  - Set up an RSS channel with a personalized identity, including a name, bio, channel image, and optional contact information.
  - Post short updates that are relayed to subscribers via RSS feeds.
  - Embrace the ethos of simplicity and self-hosted solutions.

### Current Status

TextRC is an experimental toy for now. The following are being implemented:

  - A script to create an RSS channel file (rss.xml), defining a userâ€™s RSS "identity."
  - A script to post updates to the channel, focusing on minimal and effective text relay.
